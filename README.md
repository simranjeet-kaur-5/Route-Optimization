This is a Flask web application for Smart route planning and management. Users are able to register, log in, 
and design travel routes from city to city. The application uses geocoding to translate city names into coordinates 
and graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, A*) to determine optimal routes. Users can list, save, update, and 
delete planned routes, and all data is stored within a SQLite database through SQLAlchemy. The application also has an 
admin page for overview statistics and includes user authentication, session management, and interactive route 
visualization.
